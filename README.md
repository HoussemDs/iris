## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoussemDs/streamlit.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the app:**
```bash
streamlit run apps/flower_prediction.py
```

## 🌸 How It Works

Our app uses machine learning to identify three beautiful Iris flower species:

### 🌺 Iris Setosa
- Known for its distinctive appearance
- Small petals and broad sepals
- Easy to identify

### 🌷 Iris Versicolor
- Medium-sized elegant flower
- Balanced petal and sepal sizes
- Beautiful color variations

### 🌹 Iris Virginica
- Largest of the three species
- Long petals and sepals
- Majestic appearance

## 📏 Measurements Guide

For best predictions, measure your Iris flower's:

1. **Sepal Length** (cm)
   - Measure from base to tip
   - Usually 4.3-7.9 cm

2. **Sepal Width** (cm)
   - Measure at widest point
   - Usually 2.0-4.4 cm

3. **Petal Length** (cm)
   - Measure from base to tip
   - Usually 1.0-6.9 cm

4. **Petal Width** (cm)
   - Measure at widest point
   - Usually 0.1-2.5 cm
